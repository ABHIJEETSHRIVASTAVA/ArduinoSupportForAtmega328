Simplest Solution To Make Arduino support For Atmega 328 (i.e with no P)

1. Extract this hardware.z
2. Copy it inside the Arduino Folder
3. When Prompted for same file exist .Select the Option for Overrite(Replace) the OLD files with NEW ones.
Because it Contains The Definations, Configuration and tools for Arduino Envirornment And compile and upload for ATmega328(no P).

HOW IT WORKS

'hardware' Folder inside Arduino Folder(Home folder of Arduino) contains Two subfolders
	1.arduino 	:-	contains Board Descriptions 
	2.Tools  	:-	contains tools for Compiling(avr-gcc) and Uploading(avrdude)
BY default Arduino Environment Does not Support Atmega328 as it does not contain Defination of Atega328 and it's tools are also does not have support for Atmega328

Solution
######################1 Adding and configuring the tools for Atmega328##################
The latest avr-gcc and avrdude Support ATmega328 but one That is included in Arduino are older Version which does not have support for it
So the LATEST AVR COMPILE AND UPLOAD TOOLS are added and configured(Configuration file for avrdude is in the location (Arduino Home)/hardware/tools/avr/etc/avrdude.conf)

ATmega328 coniguration is added just after the configuration of ATmega328P


######################2 Adding Uno a new board in Arduino Environment##################
Configuration For Atmega328 is almost similar to Atmega328P
Configuration File is in (Arduino Home)/hardware/arduino/boards.txt
The new Board is added in 2nd Position in Configuration file with:-
ID=uno328
name=Arduino Uno w/Atmega328(no P)
mcu=atmega328

All the rest details will Be similar to ATMega328p
